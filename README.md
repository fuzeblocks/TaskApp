Greetings, this is my inaugural JavaFX application, therefore the design was crafted by ChatGPT as I am not yet familiar with FXML coding.
So keep cool and I'm open for every review. TaskApp it's a JavaFX app, so you can Create/Edit/Delete task. In the Task, you can add a priority, content, title, choice the language of the app and other.
And more feature is going (Reminders, Colors in the title, Pictures etc....). 
If you want to contribute, contact me and fork the project.
Good bye!
