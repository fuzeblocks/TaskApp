Hello, this is my first of all apps using JavaFX so the style has been made by ChatGPT because at this time I don't know how to code in FXML. So keep cool and I'm open for every review.
TaskApp it's a JavaFX app, so you can Create/Edit/Delete task.
In the Task, you can add a priority, content, title, choice the language of the app.
And more feature is going (Reminders,Colors in the title, Pictures etc...). 
If you want to contribute, contact me and fork the project.
Good bye!
